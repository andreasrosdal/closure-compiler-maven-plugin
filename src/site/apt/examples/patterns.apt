Using include/exclude patterns

  This plugin supports include/exclude patterns. When bundling into one file, the order in which the source files were specified is preserved. Specifically:

  * For each <<<include>>>, find all files matching the wildcard pattern (observing the <<<excludes>>>).

  * For each <<<include>>>, sort the matching files alphabetically.
  
  * Then add the matching files for each <<<include>>> in the order the <<<includes>>> were specified.
